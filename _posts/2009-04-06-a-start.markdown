<p>Learning English is just a joke without practicing. So, it is why this post sees the light.<br />
Honestly, I don't know if there exists some funny things can be recorded in this post. But, well, actually some things happened.<br />
I started to download <em>The Big Bang Theory<&#47;em> tonight, because I really love the tees of Sheldon's. I plan to buy one or more from Taobao. Another reason maybe one episode of <em>Gossip Girl<&#47;em> each week is not enough for me. I should keep my ears being filled of English words when I'm busy doing nothing, lol.<br />
I think 100 words is enough. So, stop here.</p>
